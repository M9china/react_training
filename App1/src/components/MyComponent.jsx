      <p className="aboutMe">Hi, my name is Nqobile Mvundlela and I'm a computer systems engineer and full stack developer. In this blog post, I would like to share my journey and passion for backend development.
      My interest in computer systems engineering started at a young age when I was fascinated by how computers worked. I was always intrigued by the inner workings of computer hardware and software, and I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in this field.
      After completing my studies in computer systems engineering, I started my career as a full stack developer, where I worked on both the frontend and backend of web applications. While I enjoyed working on the frontend, I found that I was more passionate about the backend.
      Working on the backend of web applications allowed me to work on the more complex and challenging aspects of software development. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of backend development, where I could use my skills in algorithms, data structures, and system design to create efficient and scalable solutions.
      As a full stack developer, I've had the opportunity to work with various programming languages and technologies. I've worked with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend technologies like Node.js, Python, and SQL.
      My passion for backend development has led me to specialize in database design, RESTful API development, and server-side programming. I love the challenge of building and optimizing databases to handle large amounts of data efficiently, and designing APIs that are secure and easy to use.
      One of my most memorable projects was building a complex e-commerce platform for a client. I was responsible for designing the database schema, building the API endpoints, and integrating the frontend with the backend. It was a challenging project, but I enjoyed every moment of it and was proud of the end result.
      In conclusion, being a computer systems engineer and full stack developer has allowed me to pursue my passion for building efficient, scalable, and secure software solutions. While I enjoy working on the frontend, my true passion lies in backend development, where I can use my skills to solve complex problems and create robust systems. I look forward to continuing my journey in this exciting field and learning new technologies and approaches to software development.</p>
