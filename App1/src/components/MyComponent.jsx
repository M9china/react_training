      <p className="text-xl text-gray">In my latest blog post, I talk about my journey as a computer systems engineer and full-stack developer, and how I discovered my passion for backend development.
       I enjoy tackling the complexity of backend development, using my skills in algorithms, data structures, and system design to create efficient and scalable solutions.
       Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of programming languages and technologies, and one of my most memorable projects was building a complex e-commerce platform.
